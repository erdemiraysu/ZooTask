## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


INSTALL NECESSARY PACKAGES:
```{r}
# install.packages("erp.easy")
library(erp.easy)
library(dplyr)
library(Hmisc)
```

LOCATE FOLDERS:

```{r}
# Locate the folder for the EEG output files (.txt) for old and new nets, replace the file location below with the one in your local device:
path_newnets <- "/Users/aysuerdemir/Desktop/R workspace/ERP_Zoo/CrossSectional/Mix/newnets/"
path_oldnets <- "/Users/aysuerdemir/Desktop/R workspace/ERP_Zoo/CrossSectional/Mix/oldnets/"
# Enter the number of participants in each group:
subs_new <- 57
subs_old <- 11
```

LOAD DATA:
* Load the data from all subjects into a dataframe for each of the 4 conditions.
* Convert all variables into factors so that the grand average function can work properly.
* Do this separately for old nets and new nets since we will process them differently based on electrode locations (electrode numbers are different)
* Make sure all files are 250m/s sampling rate - downsample beforehand if needed. Code would not run if a child has higher sampling rate. 

```{r}
# Load data into dataframes for each condition separately (the exported .txt files appear separately for each condition):
neg_go <- load.data(path_newnets,"NegGo", subs_new, -100, 999) 
neg_nogo <- load.data(path_newnets,"NegNoGo", subs_new, -100, 999)
neut_go <- load.data(path_newnets,"NeutGo", subs_new, -100, 999)
neut_nogo <- load.data(path_newnets,"NeutNoGo", subs_new, -100, 999)

# Combine all conditions together into a single dataframe:
combo_new <- rbind.data.frame(neg_go, neg_nogo, neut_go, neut_nogo) 
combo_new <- as.data.frame(unclass(combo_new), stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

# Repeat for old nets:
neg_go_old <- load.data(path_oldnets,"NegGo", subs_old, -100, 999) 
neg_nogo_old <- load.data(path_oldnets,"NegNoGo", subs_old, -100, 999)
neut_go_old <- load.data(path_oldnets,"NeutGo", subs_old, -100, 999)
neut_nogo_old <- load.data(path_oldnets,"NeutNoGo", subs_old, -100, 999)

combo_old <- rbind.data.frame(neg_go_old, neg_nogo_old, neut_go_old, neut_nogo_old) 
combo_old <- as.data.frame(unclass(combo_old),stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

```

SPECIFY THE ELECTRODE NUMBERS FOR P2, N2 and P3:
```{r}
# We are only interested in frontal P2 (positive) and N2 (negative)
# Posterior P3 and Frontal P3

p2n2_newnets <- c("V4","V5","V10","V11","V12","V16","V18","V19") 
p2n2_oldnets <- c("V4","V5","V10","V11","V12","V16","V19", "V20")
p3_newnets <- c("V54","V61","V62","V67","V72","V77","V78","V79") 
p3_oldnets <- c("V54","V61","V62","V67","V68","V73","V78","V79","V80") 

#Create average waveform plots for each subject in a single, multiplot window
mosaic(combo_new, p2n2_newnets, cols = 3, rows = 2)
mosaic(combo_new, p3_newnets, cols = 3, rows = 2)

```

CODE BELOW GETS ALL THE MEASURES (N2, P2, P3) FROM OLD AND NEW NET DATA, COMBINE THEM TOGETHER AND IT SAVES THE DATA INTO A FINAL COMBO SPREADSHEET:

* The dependent measures we use are mean amplitude (microvolts) and latency (in ms) for statistical analysis. 
* m.measures gives the mean amplitude for a specific window and its dt dev. along with its graph. 
specify lgnd = "n" (no legend) if you do not want the legend 
* p.measures calculates local or simple peak amplitude and latency for each condition in the data frame. Use latency only from p.measures
* pol = The polarity of peaks to favor when multiple peaks are present. Entering "pos" will locate the most positive peak. Entering "neg" will locate the most negative peak. Entering "abs" will find the greatest deviation from 0, regardless of the polarity.  

# CHECK THE WINDOW RANGE FOR EACH ERP COMPONENT AND ADJUST AS NEEDED!

# Replace NA values in a specific column based on a condition:
